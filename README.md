### Reasoning

<details>
<summary>How do I dropdown?</summary>
<br>
This is how you dropdown.
</details>
My thought process for the templates was so:

I need to be able to display the "base" everywhere, this includes
the navbar and the footer only. So, I needed **base.html**.

I need to display a main page that informs the user of steps to take to sign up / log in, just as
important, we want to create an inviting feeling by communicating the value of joining the bank and the
advantages of different accounts and cards. So, I used **index.html**.

I wanted a feel of ease and brevity for the sign-up and log-in, so I use a different file for each. There is *
*log_in.html** and **sign_up.html**.

I took inspiration from my own (real) banking app and wanted to be able to show the customer's profile
in a way that was easy to use, and that only showed the most important data/information for the user's convenience.
Hence, I need **account.html**.

I also knew I needed a secure feel for the transactions, I wanted the look to help the user
focus more on their transaction so they could feel confident in typing and having the right info.
So I made **transactions.html**.
